<p>This curious little book from 1899 tries to predict the future a hundred years onward. With 1999 now also being part of history, it is interesting to see what has come of these predictions. Some interesting things, imagine a United States of America covering both the North and South American continents, but also some very period related sentiments shine through, such as the then recent Spanish-American war... Spain is really the bitten dog in this book. Much is made good by some illustrations, such as the electric valet and aerial bicycles.

<p>During F1, please place the numerous side-notes as a single [sidenote: ...] next to the first line on which they appear. 
Due to the OCR, they now appear at the bottom of the page (They can stay there until the F-Rounds, but please proof them.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
